**OVERVIEW**
I have created a basic website's Layout using only HTML and CSS with some advance CSS rules defined in it
Following is a list of files and some important descriptions used in designing of this website's Layout

index.html
This file contains firstly the links to CSS folder which has three files (style.css, utils.css and responsive.css)
then some basic html tags are used to create a structure of the page consisting of (header, main section and footer)

**CSS**
1. style.css
	This file has all the rules defined for the designing of the whole page along with linear gradient style used to 
	set the background of header footer and main body 
2. utils.css
	This file is basically for utilities of the page, it includes styles of some specific classes and description 
	based tags like paragraphs.
3. responsive.css
	This file has all the rules defined for the purpose of making page responsive (with glass effects in it).
